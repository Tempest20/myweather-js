# MyWeather - JS
-----------------------

A simple weather forecast made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a bit of jQuery for some visual effects).

I used the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch the data. 



Using **MyWeather** is very straight-forward and intuitive, all you need to do is type in the name of the city you want to see the weather for.
